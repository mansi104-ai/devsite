This project involves several Python scripts, each serving a unique purpose:

- **`train.py`**: Responsible for training the model using provided data.
- **`predict.py`**: Used for making predictions based on the trained model.
- **`map.py`**: Contains functions for converting geographical coordinates.
- **`location.py`**: Manages location data and file reading.
- **`draw.py`**: (Not detailed in the provided code but likely for visualizing results).

## Training the Model

The training process involves reading city data, transforming it into a suitable format, and fitting a logistic regression model. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the `train.py` script:

- **Data Preparation**: The `get_city_set` function extracts unique city names from the input data.
- **Mapping Cities**: The `read_file` function creates a mapping of city names to integer labels.
- **Model Training**: The `Trainer` class handles the training process, where the model is fitted to the transformed data.

### Example Code for Training

```python
from sklearn.externals import joblib
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

class Trainer(object):
    def __init__(self, map, binary):
        self.map = map
        self.binary = binary

    def train(self, data):
        x, y = self.__transform(data)
        model = LogisticRegression(multi_class='multinomial', solver='saga')
        model.fit(x, y)
        return model
