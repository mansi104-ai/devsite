# Business Decision Making Project Report

The **Business Decision Making (BDM)** project was centered around analyzing sales data for a retail company using Python to extract meaningful insights and recommend actionable strategies. The project aimed to support decision-making processes, improve operational efficiency, and boost sales performance.

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyzed a dataset containing information about sales transactions, customer demographics, and product categories. Using Pythonâ€™s data analysis libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, we were able to clean, process, and visualize the data, which aided in identifying sales patterns and customer behaviors.

The core objectives of the project were:
- **Sales Analysis**: To analyze the sales data for identifying trends and seasonality.
- **Customer Segmentation**: To segment the customer base and target promotions effectively.
- **Product Performance**: To evaluate which products were performing well and which were underperforming.
- **Recommendations**: To suggest actionable business strategies based on the analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

We employed a variety of tools and technologies to ensure the efficient processing and analysis of data:
1. **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
2. **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
3. **NumPy**: For numerical operations and calculations.
4. **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
5. **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models (if required for prediction).
6. **Jupyter Notebooks**: For documenting the entire analysis process.

## Data Processing Steps

The first step was to preprocess the sales data. This included handling missing values, filtering unnecessary columns, and normalizing the data to standardize the scale of numerical columns.

```python
# Sample data preprocessing code
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")

# Fill missing values
data.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Normalize sales values
data['normalized_sales'] = (data['sales'] - data['sales'].mean()) / data['sales'].std()

## Key Insights

### 1. Sales Trends
Using time series analysis, we identified that the company's sales peaked during the holiday season, particularly in November and December. This pattern helped us suggest an increased marketing spend before the holiday season to capitalize on the higher customer demand.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot sales trends
plt.plot(data['date'], data['sales'])
plt.title('Sales Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.show()

###2. Customer Segmentation
By clustering customer demographic data, we were able to segment the customer base into three groups: high-spenders, medium-spenders, and low-spenders. This segmentation allows the company to tailor its promotional efforts.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Apply KMeans clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
data['customer_segment'] = kmeans.fit_predict(data[['annual_income', 'spending_score']])

###3. Product Performance
By analyzing product-level data, we identified that certain product categories, such as electronics, consistently outperformed others, such as home goods. This led to a recommendation to reallocate shelf space and inventory to better-performing categories.

```python
# Product category analysis
product_sales = data.groupby('product_category')['sales'].sum()
product_sales.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Product Category Performance')
plt.xlabel('Product Category')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
plt.show()
